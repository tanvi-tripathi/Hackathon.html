      <h2>Top Budgeting Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Set Clear Financial Goals</h3>
          <p>Identify both short-term and long-term financial goals, like saving for a trip, paying off debt, or building an emergency fund.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Use the 50/30/20 Rule</h3>
          <p>Divide your income into: 50% needs, 30% wants, and 20% savings. This rule helps you stay balanced and on track.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3. Track Every Expense</h3>
          <p>Track everything you spend, from coffee to textbooks, to understand your financial habits and where you can save.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>4. Prioritize Needs Over Wants</h3>
          <p>Focus on essentials first—like rent and food—before spending on non-essentials like entertainment or shopping.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>5. Build an Emergency Fund</h3>
          <p>Save a small portion of your income each month for unexpected expenses, like medical bills or repairs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>6. Cut Costs Where You Can</h3>
          <p>Save money on textbooks, transportation, and food. Consider alternatives like public transit, meal prepping, or buying used textbooks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>7. Avoid Impulse Purchases</h3>
          <p>Wait 24 hours before making non-essential purchases. Often, the urge to buy will pass, and you'll save money.</p>
